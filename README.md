# Living Room VR

This project was created as part of the Virtual Reality Specialization offered by the [University of London](https://www.london.ac.uk/).

# Project Description

This project is a virtual reality experience of a cozy living room, designed for various Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs). Users can explore a detailed 3D environment featuring a spacious living area with sofas, a round coffee table with a vase, point lights in form of lamps and spotlights in form of wall lights. There is also a 4K TV with spatial audio. The scene aims to provide an immersive and realistic home interior experience.

# Instructions

To view the project in Unity, open the "MainScene" in Project Assets/Scenes. This is the main scene where users should experience the VR environment. An XR Device Simulator has been added to the project, allowing you to experience the VR environment directly within Unity without the need to build it on a physical device. Simply run the scene in Unity to explore the room using the XR Device Simulator. If you are going to build this project for some device, make sure to remove XR Device Simulator from the Project Hierarchy.

The room features three teleport anchors for easy navigation. To teleport:

* **In the XR Device Simulator within Unity:** Hold the Space key and press W in play mode.
* **On a physical VR controller after building:** Press up on the right thumbstick of your right controller.

# Hardware Restrictions

This project is designed to work with various HMDs such as Meta Quest, Valve Index, and HTC Vive. The project uses Unity version 2022.3.50f1. While it should work on most modern VR-capable devices, performance may vary depending on the device's capabilities.
